# Bayesian AB Testing Example

## Purpose

Example dashboard used to analyze feature AB testing using the [BayesAB](http://frankportman.github.io/bayesAB/) package.

The dashboard tests variations against a control group and provides the probability that the variation is greater than the control group. A user can update Alpha and Beta parameters as well as adjusting the desired lift between groups.

_Note: All Data is randomly generated using the function: [functions/f_generate_data.R](functions/f_generate_data.R)._
